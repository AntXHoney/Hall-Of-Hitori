                This is Hitori Gotoh, a student with social anxiety but wants to have lots of friends.
                She might not look like it, but she plays the guitar exceptionally well! Known as "Guitar Hero"
                in her youtube. Due to her anxiety she cannot talk to another person(with the exception of her family)
                in the eye. Until one fateful day, she met a drummer from another school Nijiki Ichiji. Nijika was
                looking for another guitarist as the previous one ran away due to "skill issue" hence she has joined
                Kessoku Band!

                    An energetic and cheerful second-year high school student. She is the drummer of Kessoku Band. 
                    The organizer of her band who takes care of Hitori was already joined Kessoku Band. 
                    Nijika was a fan of "guitarhero", and eventually realizes that she was actually Hitori, 
                    but this makes her become more confident of achieving her dream. Until it was revealed to 
                    everyone by Poison♡Yami, she kept it a secret from other members. Although she has her limits 
                    with Bocchi as of late due to the latter's self esteem where she felt that Bocchi needs to grow a spine.

                    A bright, popular, and "socially powered" first-year high school student. She is the guitarist 
                    and lead vocalist of Kessoku Band. Originally, she joined the band and then ran away because she 
                    lied about knowing how to play the guitar just to be near Ryo, whom she admires deeply. After 
                    Hitori helped her overcome her guilt and taught her the basics, she rejoined with a new determination. 
                    Her "Kita-aura" is so bright it often overwhelms the introverted Hitori, yet she is incredibly kind and 
                    acts as the band's social bridge. She is the most active member on social media and constantly 
                    looks for ways to make the band more popular, all while diligently practicing her guitar to keep up with Hitori's talent.

                    A cool, eccentric, and fiercely independent second-year high school student. She is the bassist 
                    of Kessoku Band and the one who composes the music. Ryo is known for her calm demeanor and her 
                    tendency to spend all her money on vintage bass guitars, often leaving her "broke" and eating 
                    weeds to survive. She was the first person to truly appreciate Hitori’s "Guitar Hero" skills from 
                    a technical standpoint, even though she often teases her. Ryo previously belonged to another band 
                    but left because she didn't want to compromise her artistic integrity, eventually forming Kessoku 
                    Band with her best friend, Nijika. She enjoys her "loner" status and often encourages Hitori to embrace 
                    her own weirdness rather than trying to fit in.
